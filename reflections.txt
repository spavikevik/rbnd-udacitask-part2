# REFLECTIONS

1. How long did you spend working on this project?
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
4. Where do you still have room to grow?



I've spent about 1 hour working on this project and other than the standard functionality required by the task specification,
I have added interactive functionality with a command prompt (using the gem highline) where the user can create lists and add or remove items from them,
because a task manager application is supposed to be interactive. Implementing the interactive prompt didn't come without its hassles
and a few bugs, but I've managed to polish it and to get it working. However, all in all, it is pretty simple, and
I think it would be a good thing to add more features to the prompt and make sure all errors and exceptions are handled perfectly.
Along with the interactive shell, I added a new Error to be used when there are no lists for manipulation available.
Oh and yes, I've added functionality for reading and storing data to yaml files. :)
